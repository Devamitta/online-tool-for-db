}
note right of entry: "variant" differentiates between various etymologically\ndifferent homonyms as e.g. PED does with superscript\nnumbers ("dhammaÂ¹" etc). "variant" is automatically assigned\nby the application.

entity "Meaning" as meaning {
<<col>> *meaning_id (primary key)
--
<<col>> meaning_text: Text
}
note right of meaning: meaning is given in the primary target language\nof the dictionary


entity "Meaning_Translation" as meaning_translation {
<<col>> *meaning_id (primary key)
--
<<col>> meaning_text: Text
<<col>> target_language: Integer 
}
note right of meaning_translation: application logic ensures that only onemeaning\ntranslation per target_language is possible
